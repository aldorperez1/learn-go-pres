### Where is Go Not a Good Language to Use?
- CPU-Intensive Tasks
- GUI Desktop Applications
- Legacy System Integration

{{% note %}}
While Go is efficient, it may not be the best choice for CPU-intensive tasks that require extensive mathematical calculations or heavy computational algorithms. Other languages like C++, Java, or Python may offer more specialized libraries and optimizations in these areas.

# GUI Desktop Applications
- Go's standard library has limited support for GUI development
- Other languages like Java, C#, JavaScript may be more suitable

{{% note %}}
Go's standard library does not provide extensive support for graphical user interface (GUI) development. If the primary focus is building desktop applications with complex UIs, other languages such as Java, C#, or JavaScript may be more suitable.

# Legacy System Integration
- Go may face challenges in direct interfacing with legacy systems written in COBOL, Fortran, etc.
- Languages with better interoperability like C or C++ may be preferred

{{% note %}}
If the project requires extensive integration with legacy systems written in languages like COBOL or Fortran, it might be challenging to directly interface with them from Go. In such cases, languages with better interoperability, like C or C++, may be preferred.
