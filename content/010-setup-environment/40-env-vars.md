# Environment Variables for Go

---
#### Environment Variable Reference
[pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Environment_variables)

#### GOPATH
Depending on how you installed `go`, you may want to ensure that, at the very least, `GOPATH` is set.

For more information on `gopath` after installation:

```sh
go help gopath
```
