# Memory Management with Go


---
# Introduction to Memory Management
- Memory management is a critical aspect of programming languages, including Go.
- In Go, memory is managed automatically by the runtime, utilizing the stack, the heap, and the garbage collector.

---
#### The Stack
- The stack is a region of memory used for local variables, function call management, and execution context.
- Variables stored on the stack have a fixed size and are organized in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.
- Stack operations are fast and efficient.

---
#### The Heap
- The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- Variables stored on the heap have a variable size and are accessed via pointers.
- Memory allocation and deallocation on the heap are managed manually by the programmer.

---
#### The Garbage Collector
- The garbage collector (GC) is a component of the Go runtime responsible for automatic memory management.
- It tracks and reclaims memory that is no longer in use to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory utilization.
- The GC identifies and collects unused memory from the heap, allowing it to be reused.

---
#### Stack, Heap, and Garbage Collector in Go
- In Go, variables with a fixed size and lifetime are stored on the stack.
- Variables with a dynamic size or longer lifetime are allocated on the heap.
- The garbage collector automatically manages the allocation and deallocation of heap memory.

Examples:
- Stack: Local variables, function arguments, return values.
- Heap: Dynamically allocated objects, arrays, slices, maps.
