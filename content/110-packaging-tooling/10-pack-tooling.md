#### Understanding the Go Toolchain
- Introduction to the Go toolchain and its importance
- Overview of the key commands and their functionalities

---
# go command

- The `go` command is the entry point for Go toolchain operations.
- It provides various subcommands for different tasks, such as building, testing, formatting, and more.

---
# go version

- The `go version` command is used to check the installed Go version on the system.
- It ensures compatibility and consistent development environments across different machines.

---
# go run

- The `go run` command allows you to quickly execute a Go source file without explicitly building an executable.
- It is useful for running single files during development and testing.

---
# go build

- The `go build` command is used to compile Go source code and generate executable binaries.
- It creates an executable file from the Go source files, ready to be executed on the same system.

---
# go clean

- The `go clean` command is used to remove object files and cached build artifacts from the project directory.
- It helps to start with a clean state, removing any files generated by the build process.

---
# go fmt

- The `go fmt` command is used to format Go source code according to the Go code style guidelines.
- It ensures consistent code style, making the code more readable and maintainable.

---
# go install

- The `go install` command compiles and installs a package or a set of packages.
- It creates an executable binary and places it in the Go bin directory, making it accessible from anywhere on the system.

---
# go get

- The `go get` command is used to download and install external packages and their dependencies.
- It fetches the raw source code of the package and sets up the package in the appropriate directory.

---
# go test

- The `go test` command is used to run tests associated with the current Go project.
- It automatically detects test files and executes the test functions, providing test coverage, benchmarks, and failure reports.
