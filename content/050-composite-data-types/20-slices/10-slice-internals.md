## Slice Internals
- Introduce the topic and its importance in understanding how slices work in Go.
- Include a relevant image or visual representation of a slice header and underlying array.
<!-- TODO: Rerun this again -->
---
## Slice Header

- Explain that a slice in Go consists of a header structure that holds metadata about the slice.
- Describe the three fields of the slice header:
  - Pointer: Memory address of the underlying array.
  - Length: Number of elements currently in the slice.
  - Capacity: Maximum number of elements the slice can hold without reallocation.

---
## Length and Capacity
- Define the length and capacity fields in more detail:
  - Length: Number of elements present in the slice.
  - Capacity: Total number of elements the current slice can accommodate.
- Explain that length and capacity are usually the same when a slice is created.

---
## Underlying Array
- Emphasize that a slice does not store its own data directly but references an underlying array.
- Illustrate how the pointer field in the slice header points to the memory address of the first element in the array.

---
## Visual Representation
- Display a visual representation of a slice header and its relationship with the underlying array.
- Highlight the pointer, length, and capacity fields, and how they interact with the array.
