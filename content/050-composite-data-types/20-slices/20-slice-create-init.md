### Slices: Create and Initalize
<!-- TODO: Needs work -->
---
## Declaring a slice of strings by length
- Code example: `var names []string`

---
## Declaring a slice of integers by length and capacity
- Code example: `numbers := make([]int, 5, 10)`

---
## Compiler error setting capacity less than length
- Mention the restriction and potential compiler error

---
## Declaring a slice with a slice literal
- Code example: `fruits := []string{"apple", "banana", "orange"}`

---
## Declaring a slice with index positions
- Code example: `colors := []string{0: "red", 2: "blue", 1: "green"}`

---
## Declaration differences between arrays and slices
- Highlight the flexibility of slices compared to arrays

---
## Declaring a nil slice
- Code example: `var data []int`

---
## Declaring an empty slice
- Code example: `scores := []int{}`
