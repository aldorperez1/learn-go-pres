## Understanding Arrays in Go
Subtitle: Exploring How Arrays Work Under the Hood

---
## Overview of Arrays
- Definition: Arrays are fixed-size sequences of elements of the same type.
- Syntax: `var arrayName [size]Type`
- Example: `var numbers [5]int`

---
## Array Indexing
- Array indexes start from 0 and go up to length - 1.
- Elements can be accessed using square bracket notation: `arrayName[index]`
- Example: `numbers[2]` accesses the element at index 2.

---
## Array Initialization
- Arrays can be initialized during declaration or assigned later.
- Initialization during declaration: `var numbers = [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Assigning values to specific indexes: `numbers[0] = 10`

---
## Iterating Over Arrays
- Go provides range-based for loops to iterate over arrays.
- Syntax: `for index, value := range arrayName { // Do something with index and value }`
- Example: `for i, num := range numbers { fmt.Println(i, num) }`

---
## Best Practices
- Use arrays when the size is fixed and known in advance.
- Consider using slices for dynamically resizable collections.
- Avoid excessive copying of arrays for better performance.
- Leverage range-based for loops for efficient iteration.
