## How Arrays Work Under the Hood

---
### Overview of Arrays

- Arrays provide a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
- In Go, arrays have a fixed length that cannot be changed.

---
### Memory Layout of Arrays

- Arrays are stored as a contiguous block of memory.
- Each element in the array occupies a fixed amount of space based on its type.
- Elements are stored in sequential order, starting from the lowest memory address to the highest.

---
### Contiguous Memory

- Elements in arrays are stored consecutively in memory with no gaps between them.
- Efficient access to array elements using indices.

---
### Element Size

- Each element occupies a fixed amount of memory based on its type.
- The size of an array is calculated by multiplying the element size by the number of elements.

---
### Indexing

- Array elements are accessed using zero-based indexing.
- Example: `arrayName[0]` accesses the first element.

---
### Memory Access

- Constant-time operation to access array elements.
- Accessing elements is efficient and independent of the array size.

---
### Memory Consumption

- Consider memory consumption when working with large arrays.
- Arrays require contiguous memory allocation.
- Creating large arrays may have implications for memory usage.
