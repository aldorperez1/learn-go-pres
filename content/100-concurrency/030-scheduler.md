# The go scheduler
Takes care of scheduling the goroutine to run. Otherwise, it would never run ðŸ˜…

---
#### The go scheduler

- Schedules/runs created go routines
- Pausing and resuming them
- blocking channel operations or mutex operations
- Coordinates
  - Blocking system calls
  - Network i/o
  - garbage collector 
- It does this for hundreds of thousands of goroutines
- Runs when goroutines cede control e.g. create a new goroutine, block

---
#### What happens once the `go` command is executed?

- Once a goroutine is created, the main goroutine stops and cedes control to the go scheduler.
- The go scheduler will multiplex it to a small number of threads
- The scheduler will try to find an idle existing thread or else create a new one.
- It will schedule the goroutine to run on that thread
- Once the scheduling done, it returns to whatever it was doing.
