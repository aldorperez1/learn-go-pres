#### Best Practices for Error Handling

- Prefer returning errors explicitly rather than using panic.
- Use defer to release resources and perform cleanup tasks.
- Handle errors as close to the source as possible to provide context and meaningful error messages.
- Avoid ignoring errors or using a blanket panic or recover statement.
- Log or report errors appropriately to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.
